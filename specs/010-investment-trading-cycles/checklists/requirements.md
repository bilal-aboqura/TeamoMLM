- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit-plan` or `/speckit-clarify`.
- Trading Report is explicitly scoped as static/dummy data for initial release (FR-011, Assumptions).
- Compound profit and multi-investment scenarios are explicitly out of scope (Assumptions).
- Profit tier thresholds are hardcoded config values for this release — not admin-configurable.
